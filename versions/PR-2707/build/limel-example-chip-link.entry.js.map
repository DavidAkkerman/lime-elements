This can also have other accessibility benefits.\n *\n * :::note\n * Clicking a link will open it in current window by default,\n * and this reloads the entire webpage.\n * To avoid reloading the whole application (in the context of a single-page apps),\n * you might want to handle the navigation with your application's router,\n * :::\n */\n@Component({\n    tag: 'limel-example-chip-link',\n    shadow: true,\n})\nexport class ChipLinkExample {\n    link = {\n        href: 'https://github.com',\n        title: 'Open Github',\n        target: '_blank',\n    };\n\n    public render() {\n        return (\n            <limel-chip\n                id=\"1\"\n                text=\"Github\"\n                icon=\"github_copyrighted\"\n                link={this.link}\n            />\n        );\n    }\n}\n"],"mappings":"qDAwBaA,EAAe,MAJ5BC,YAAAC,G,UAKIC,KAAAC,KAAO,CACHC,KAAM,qBACNC,MAAO,cACPC,OAAQ,S,CAGLC,SACH,OACIC,EAAA,cACIC,GAAG,IACHC,KAAK,SACLC,KAAK,qBACLR,KAAMD,KAAKC,M"}
